# TenLinkedList
TenLinkedList is an innovative custom linked list implementation designed to significantly improve retrieval and deletion operations, boasting an impressive speed enhancement of approximately 8 times compared to traditional linked lists. This advanced data structure optimizes node connectivity by establishing references not only to the immediate front and back nodes but also to the 10th node ahead and 10th node behind.

The primary focus of this project was to engineer a high-performance linked list that excels in the retrieval and deletion of node elements. By incorporating these extended connections, EnhancedTenLinkedList revolutionizes the efficiency of traversing the linked list, resulting in remarkable time complexity improvements for common operations.
